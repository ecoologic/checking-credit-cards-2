## Problem

Write a ruby program that accepts credit card numbers. Card numbers must be passed in line by line (one set of numbers per line)
The program should print the card in the following format "TYPE: NUMBERS (VALIDITY)"

## Console

    bundle exec ruby console.rb

## Test

    bundle exec rspec

## Comments

* `CreditCard::ALL`: open structs could become regular classes, but it's ok for now
* `credit_card_console_spec.rb` could be cleaner, but it's ok for now
